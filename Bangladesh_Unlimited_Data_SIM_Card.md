If you're here on business, the Business SIM is tailored for you. It includes features like priority customer support and dedicated numbers for international calls, making it easier to stay connected with clients and colleagues back home.

For those who plan to stay longer or live in Bangladesh, the Local SIM is ideal. It allows you to register using local documents, which is essential if you're moving here for an extended stay. The Local SIM also offers flexible plans that suit different lifestyles and budgets.

One thing that sets us apart is our commitment to convenience. Registering for our SIM cards is straightforward. For tourists, simply provide your passport information during the purchase process.
