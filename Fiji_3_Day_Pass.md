One of the best features of the Fiji 3-Day Pass is its flexibility. You can choose between different types of SIM cards based on your needs. For instance, if you prefer a physical SIM card that you can easily insert into your device, we have options that cater to both GSM and CDMA phones. Alternatively, if you're traveling light and prefer a digital solution, our eSIMs (electronic SIMs) are a fantastic choice. These digital SIMs allow you to connect without carrying extra hardware, making them perfect for modern travelers who value convenience.

For those who rely heavily on mobile data, the Fiji 3-Day Pass offers generous data allowances.

Plus, with the option to purchase additional data packs, you can extend your usage if needed.

Another great aspect of the Fiji 3-Day Pass is its compatibility with international roaming. If you're coming from abroad and already have an unlocked phone, you can easily switch to our local network, avoiding hefty roaming charges. This means you can call and text internationally at competitive rates, keeping in touch with loved ones back home without worrying about exorbitant fees.

Setting up your Fiji 3-Day Pass is straightforward. Simply visit our website or download our app, select the type of SIM card or eSIM that suits you, and follow the instructions to activate your pass.
