For those who prefer the simplicity of prepaid plans, we provide top-up options that allow you to add credit as you go. This is perfect if you want to control your spending while still enjoying high-speed data.

Another great feature of our SIM cards is their compatibility with international roaming. If you’re traveling from outside Europe, rest assured that your phone will work seamlessly in Andorra. All you need to do is insert the SIM card into your device, and you’re ready to go. No complicated setup required!

But wait, there’s more! We also offer **eSIMs**, which are digital SIM cards that eliminate the hassle of physical SIM cards. With eSIMs, you can easily switch between carriers and countries without swapping out SIM cards. It’s the ultimate solution for tech-savvy travelers who value convenience and efficiency.

Our customer service team is available 24/7 to assist you with any questions or issues you might encounter. From activating your SIM card to troubleshooting connectivity problems, we’re here to make your experience as smooth as possible.
