Now, here’s the exciting part: we offer three main types of products to suit every traveler’s needs – **SIM cards**, **data-only SIM cards**, and **eSIMs**. Let’s break them down so you know exactly which one fits your style.

- **SIM Cards**: These are physical SIM cards that you insert into your phone. They come preloaded with credits that allow you to make calls, send texts, and use data. If you prefer simplicity and don’t mind carrying around an extra piece of hardware, this option is perfect for you. Plus, our SIM cards work seamlessly across all major networks in Greece, ensuring maximum coverage wherever you go.

- **Data-Only SIM Cards**: As the name suggests, these SIM cards provide internet access without including voice or text services. Ideal for tech-savvy travelers who prioritize online connectivity above all else, these cards ensure smooth streaming, browsing, and app usage throughout your journey. No more worrying about running out of data mid-trip!

- **eSIMs**: For those who love cutting-edge technology, eSIMs are the way to go. Unlike traditional SIM cards, eSIMs are digital and can be activated remotely via your smartphone. This means no more waiting in long lines at airports or stores to swap out physical SIMs. Simply download the eSIM onto your device and enjoy hassle-free connectivity from day one. And guess what? Our eSIMs support both international roaming and local plans, giving you the best of both worlds.

But wait, there’s more! We understand that budget matters when traveling, which is why we’ve created flexible pricing options to fit your wallet.
