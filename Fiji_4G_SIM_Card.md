Whether you’re a frequent traveler or just visiting for a short time, our SIM cards cater to all types of users. We offer both prepaid and postpaid plans, giving you the flexibility to choose what suits your needs best. Prepaid plans are ideal for those who want to manage their spending while enjoying unlimited data, while postpaid options might be better for long-term users who prefer a more structured billing system.

Our Fiji 4G SIM cards also come with generous data allowances. Depending on your plan, you can enjoy high-speed internet access that’s perfect for streaming your favorite shows, video calling your loved ones, or even working remotely if you’re a digital nomad. Plus, we’ve got special deals for heavy data users, so you don’t have to worry about running out of data mid-trip.

And here’s another exciting perk: our SIM cards support international roaming. If you’re traveling from abroad, you can easily connect to Fiji’s network without breaking the bank. Just pop in the SIM card, and you’re good to go. No need to hassle with complicated settings or configurations—our SIM cards are user-friendly and ready to use right out of the box.

For those who love staying ahead of the curve, we also offer eSIMs (Embedded SIMs). These tiny, integrated chips allow you to activate your SIM card directly on your smartphone without needing a physical card. It’s a modern solution for travelers who prefer convenience and don’t want to carry around extra SIM cards. Simply scan the QR code provided by us, and you’ll have instant access to Fiji’s 4G network.
