When choosing a SIM card or eSIM, consider what you’ll primarily use it for. If you’re a heavy data user, look for plans with generous data allowances and affordable rates. If you plan on making frequent calls, opt for a plan that includes more minutes. Additionally, check if the provider supports roaming, especially if you plan on traveling to nearby countries.

No matter which option you choose, staying connected in Djibouti is easier than ever. Whether you prefer the convenience of a physical SIM card or the flexibility of an eSIM, there’s a solution that fits your lifestyle.
