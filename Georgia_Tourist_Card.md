It’s like having a personal chauffeur who knows every corner of the city. For those who love to move around easily, this is a dream come true!

But wait, there’s more! The **Deluxe Card** takes things to the next level by including free admission to some of Georgia’s most iconic museums and attractions. Picture yourself strolling through the ancient streets of Old Tbilisi or marveling at the stunning views from Narikala Fortress. With the Deluxe Card, these experiences become yours for the taking. Plus, you’ll enjoy discounts at select restaurants and shops, allowing you to savor Georgian cuisine and shop for unique souvenirs without breaking the bank.

Now, let’s talk about something that’s absolutely essential for modern travelers: **phone cards and data plans**. In today’s digital age, staying connected is crucial. That’s why the Georgia Tourist Card also offers options for mobile SIM cards and eSIMs. Whether you prefer a physical SIM card or want to go completely digital with an eSIM, we’ve got you covered. 

For those who like to keep things simple, a **physical SIM card** is perfect. Just pop it into your phone, and you’re good to go. No complicated settings or downloads required. And guess what?
